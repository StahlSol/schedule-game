# Cheff Cleff: Invitation Simulator
*“Get Cheff Cleff to commit to one social event. If you can.”*

## Overview
**Cheff Cleff: Party Inviter Simulator** is a short, dialogue-driven game played entirely through a simulated messaging interface.  
The player's objective is to get Cleff to agree to attend an event on a day he is actually free — despite vague replies, limited messaging, and random real-life interruptions.

---

## Core gameplay loop
1. Player selects the event window (6–9 days).  
2. Player may send **10 messages total** across those days.  
3. Clayton replies with varying accuracy, tone, and timing.  
4. Player picks which day will be the event.  
5. The game resolves on the **Day of Reckoning** (success or one of many failure reasons).

---

## Messaging system
- UI simulates a messaging app (timestamps, typing bubbles, read receipts optional).  
- Player chooses how many messages to send each day (subject to the 10-message cap).  
- Over-messaging in a single day → Cleff becomes overwhelmed and may ignore messages.  
- Asking **too far in advance** yields “my schedule isn't released that far out” (wastes a message).  
- Asking **too late** can cause automatic conflicts (“I already made plans”).  
- Long/compound messages risk upsetting Clayton and may cause immediate negative outcomes.

## Player constraints

| Resource      | Limit       | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Messages      | 10 total    | Strategic communication budget. |
| Days window   | 8–11 days   | Player chooses the length during the session based on their impression of his schedule. |
| Mood   (Todo) | 0–10        | Depletes with messaging and bad interactions; affects RNG. |

## Game Week:

- [1] Thursday  
- [2] Friday
- [3] Saturday
- [4] Sunday
- [5] Monday
- [6] Tuesday     [Random new events added to schedule]
- [7] Wednesday
- [8] Thursday    [Possible event day]
- [9] Friday      [Possible event day]
- [10] Saturday   [Possible event day]
- [11] Sunday     [Possible event day]

## Hidden mechanics & RNG
- Clayton’s real schedule is **hidden** and only hinted at via vague replies (e.g. “Probably free in the afternoon”).  
- Each scheduled plan has hidden constraints (work end times, naps, etc.) which are not fully revealed to the player.  
- Random sabotage events can occur and guarantee failure even if the day is correctly chosen (examples: car trouble, family call, sudden work shift, hungover).  
- The chance of these events is affected by Clayton’s mood and prior interactions.

---

## Day of Reckoning (resolution)
- **Success:** Clayton shows up.  
- **Failure:** A personalized excuse is delivered (e.g. “Forgot,” “Work called me in,” “Too tired after work,” “Something came up,” etc.).  
- Outcome text explains *why* Clayton didn’t come.

---

## Mood & impact
- The **Mood Bar** (visual element) represents Clayton’s tolerance and patience.  
- Mood decreases with: many messages, alarmist/compound messages, and annoying timing.  
- Mood influences:
  - Helpfulness/clarity of responses.  
  - Likelihood of RNG failures.  
  - Probability Clayton honors the plan.

---

## Design philosophy
- No explicit tutorials — players learn by experimenting and failing.  
- Tone is comedic, dry, and painfully relatable.  
- Focus on short play sessions and strong emergent narrative from poor communication.

---

## Planned features
- Message-app styled GUI (typing indicators, subtle sounds).  
- Post-game summary explaining what went wrong/right.  
- Achievements for interesting edge-case outcomes.
- Rely on a large pool of pre-written dialogue options and responses
- Utilize many flags that will alter the responses slightly with dynamic string creation

## 🧠 Cheff Cleff Behavior Systems

Below is a breakdown of all core logic and RNG systems that govern Cheff’s behavior throughout the simulation.

---

### 🗓️ 1. Schedule Generation
- At the start of a session, a full weekly schedule is **randomly generated** for Cleff.
- Each day has an **85% base chance** to be a **work day**.
- Days marked as **off** have a **25% chance** at the start of the day to become a **call-in work day**.
- In the event of a call-in, the **type of work shift** is determined using the same probabilities as a normal work day.
- Since each day’s data is generated independently, **you cannot infer** future work days from known ones.

---

### 🕐 2. Work Day Types
Depending on the RNG roll, Cleff’s work schedule and communication patterns differ:

| Work Type | Probability | Work Hours | Response Behavior | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Late Shift** | 65% | 12 PM – 8 PM | Responds in the morning only; ignores evening messages (final message guaranteed) | Common default shift |
| **Mid Shift** | 25% | 10 AM – 6 PM | May respond morning or night; 15% chance of **double-booking** | Most flexible |
| **Early Shift** | 10% | 8 AM – 4 PM | Only responds at night | Rarest schedule |

---

### 💬 3. Communication Rules
- Asking about a date **more than 4 days ahead** triggers:  
  > “I don’t have my schedule for that day yet.”
- **Response probability** (for unanswered messages):  
  \[
  90\% - (8\% \times \text{hours since message})
  \]
  - Example: After 5 hours, there’s a 50% response chance.
- Cleff is **guaranteed to respond once before bed** each day.
- If multiple messages are sent close together, message freshness may override older ones.

---

### 🍻 4. Hungover Condition
- **10% daily chance** for Cleff to start the day hungover.  
- While hungover:
  - No responses are possible until evening.
  - Mood temporarily set to **–10** for that day.
- Condition automatically clears at the **start of the next day**.

---

### 📆 5. Dynamic Schedule Events
- Beginning **on Day 5**, each remaining day has a **35% chance** to spontaneously generate a **new evening plan**, if Cleff isn’t working late.
- These spontaneous plans can cause **conflicts** with scheduled events.

---

### 🎟️ 6. Event Preferences
- There are **three event types**:
  1. Streamer Event  
  2. Rock Climbing  
  3. Going Drinking  
- At the start of each session, Cleff is in the mood for **exactly one** of these.  
- The event he’s in the mood for is **randomly chosen** between the **two events not suggested first** (the first suggestion is **always declined**).

---

### 🕑 7. Scheduling Behavior
- Suggesting a **specific time** always results in a **positive response**, regardless of actual availability:  
  > “That sounds fun, I’ll try to make it!”
- However, this **does not guarantee attendance** — the day of the event will run final checks to see if he actually shows.

---

### ⚖️ 8. Event Day Resolution
On the scheduled event day, the game simulates Cleff’s day and runs sequential checks to determine attendance:

1. ✅ **Original Schedule** — Is he working that day?  
2. 📞 **Call-In Check** — Was he unexpectedly called into work?  
3. 😒 **Mood Check** — `(100 - mood)%` chance to skip.  
4. 🧠 **Memory Check** — `(100 - memory freshness)%` chance to forget.  
5. 🎲 **Random Failure** — Flat 25% chance “something came up.”  

If any check fails:
- The event is canceled.
- Player receives an apology/excuse message referencing the last relevant flag (e.g. “Sorry, got called in,” “Something came up,” “Totally forgot!”).

---

### ❤️ 9. Mood & Memory Systems
- **Mood** fluctuates daily due to:
  - Message frequency or tone.
  - Hungover status.
  - Failed scheduling attempts.
- **Memory freshness** decays the longer ago the plan was made.  
  Recent plans = higher recall; old ones = higher “forgot” chance.

---

## Player Mechanics

Each hour, the player can select one action:

### Core Actions
- **Suggest Event** – Choose from 3 event options (Streamer, Rock Climb, Drink)
- **Ask About X Day** – Check Cleff’s availability for a given day
- **Set / Reschedule Event** – Confirm or adjust the event date
- **Remind Him** – Boosts event memory freshness
- **Poke** – Nudges for a reply (resets message freshness slightly)
- **Wait 1 Hour** – Advances time by 1 hour (until 11pm)
- **Sleep** – Ends the day
